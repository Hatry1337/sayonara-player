  There is currently a snap-related issue regarding the directory chooser.
  So the native directory dialog has been disabled for snap packages. 
  If you want to try the native dialogs, you can set it in 
  File -> Preferences -> User Interface -> Force native dialogs.
  It usually doesn't work in the KDE environment.
